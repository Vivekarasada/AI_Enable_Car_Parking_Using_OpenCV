## Description of Project

Our AI-Enabled Car Parking system harnesses the immense potential 
of Artificial Intelligence and OpenCV, the industry-leading computer 
vision library, to perform real-time object detection. By accurately 
identifying available parking spaces, our system empowers drivers 
with the information they need to efficiently navigate crowded parking 
areas.
